# Delete Chat Messages

This PowerShell script searches the workplace messages sent or received by a specific user for a predefined keyword or sentence and allows for the deletion of the selected message.<br/>

## Setup

* Create a new Custom Integration in the Workplace Admin Panel: [Create a custom Integration](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/workplace/custom-integrations-new/#creating).
<br/>This requires at least "Read all messages" permissions.
<br/>Take note of the Access Token.

* Create a file named `accessToken.js` with the following content:

   ```javascript
   {
         "accessToken" : "YOUR-ACCESS-TOKEN"
   }
   ```

 * Retrieve the User Id of the message sender or receiver by heading to the Admin Panel -> People
 <br/>Select the desired user and click on their name to navigate to their profile page
 <br/>From URL of the user profile page, copy the user ID e.g. profile.php?id={USER ID}

## Run

* Run the script by passing the `accessToken.js` file as input:

   ```powershell
   ./RetrieveMessageInfo.ps1 -WPAccessToken accessToken.js -WPUser <User ID> -MessageContent "test message"
   ```

   For example if I sent a message stating "This is a test, please ignore" <br/>
   I can set -MessageContent "This is a test" and the script will retrieve all the messages I sent or received which are including the sentence "This is a test".   </br>
   </br>
   It is also possible to search by date instead by running the script as:

   ```powershell
   ./RetrieveMessageInfo.ps1 -WPAccessToken accessToken.js -WPUser <User ID> -MessageDate <YYYY-MM-DD>
   ```
   This will retrieve all messages sent by a specific user on the specified date. This search method is recommended when searching for pictures/gifs.
   </br>
   *Note 1: It is possible to use both MessageContent and MessageDate during a search, this will help narrow down the results by filtering the messages which contain a specific text AND have been sent/received on the specified date.
   </br>
   *Note 2: If the target WPUser hid a chat window in Workplace, this script will not return any results for the hid chat window. It is still possible to retrieve the message ids by targeting a different user who was part of that chat and didn't hid that chat OR ask the target user to unhide the chat.

   *Note: Although MessageContent and MessageDate are not required parameters, the search will return no results unless at least one of them is specified.
